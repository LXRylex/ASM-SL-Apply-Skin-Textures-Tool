> funny thing: this video was 372mb and SQUASHED to 6.5MB just to put in github lol

## Explanation:

What this does is instead of having to use UABEA for importing your own Textures using this tool will make the process faster and simpler

feel free to ask any questions oh and also as why its 156MB well, i tried to pack it as an actual .EXE but it just wont work giving me errors and headache the exe itself is 8mb but the " _internal " is the libraries that are reqauired to do the job (its all python libraries)

## Some Features:

**Import** = prompts you to import the textures/pngs you made to replace

**Skip** = Does not make any change to the selected texture/file it skips them

**Delete** = Replaces the texturte with 1x1 pixel to make it invisible (which is what i used for the decal)
> it's useful to hide the unwanted textures and you can come back to it later to import your own decal texture

## Installation:

Once you extract the **.zip** you'll have a folder just go in it and run the **exe** there, have fun!
you can get the tool from releases tab
